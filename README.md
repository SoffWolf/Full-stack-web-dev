# Full-stack-web-dev
The repository is my submission to the course "Full Stack Web Development" from University of Helsinki.

The submission is divided into part (aka the large program, for example "The Phonebook"). In each part, there are multiple folders, and each contains the src folder of one exercise given by the course (for example file "2.5" contains the "src" folder of 2.5 exercise). 

My point when I choose this kind of submission is that it would be easier for the assessment process. All the necessary files are in that "src" folder. All you have to do is take that src, replace it with the "src" in the React fodler on your machine, and run the folder with command "npm start".
